# Recurring-Tasks-for-notion
Notionâ€™s lack of a built-in recurring task feature. Currently, thereâ€™s no way to tell the Checkbox property to un-check itself on a certain date. Additionally, the Date property doesnâ€™t allow for repeating dates.
Using this formula and embedding it will replicate the functionality for now, untill notion adds it (ofcourseðŸ˜œ)
